## Requirement to follow AI coding constitution

When conducting any task, the AI agent must read and follow the AI Coding Constitution, as set out in @/windows/ManuscriptaTeacherApp/docs/specifications/AICodingConstitution.md, and the specifications. If this is not in the current branch, the AI agent must retrieve from the same location in the windows-app branch.

Coding in the designated procedure is equally as important as producing working code.
