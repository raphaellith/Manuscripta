# Notes:
# - This workflow runs on Windows to match the Windows app focus, but the project is ASP.NET Core and
#   can also build on Linux/macOS if desired (change `runs-on`).
# - Enforcing coverage thresholds via the `/p:Threshold` properties requires the test projects to reference
#   the `coverlet.msbuild` NuGet package. If you prefer to compute coverage from the produced 'coverage.opencover.xml',
#   add a ReportGenerator step to create an HTML summary and a script step to parse and enforce thresholds.
